# guess-the-number-game

For this assignment, I wanted to learn the basics of JavaScript by creating a number guessing game. The basis of this project is for the computer to pick a random number between 1 -100, and you have to guess what it is.  If the number were guessed too low or too high, It would print a statement saying " Too High or Too low."  It would also show guess history and a reset button for the user to start over.  I learned how to manipulate the DOM by using document.getElementById to click the element and add an event listener to listen for the result.
